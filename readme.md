> But what is a _Metarepo_? Isn't this just a monorepo? And if so, why are there so many unrelated packages here?

The _Metarepo_ is a new concept that we are trying out to simplify the development process. Many of the projects are dependencies of each other, so we can iterate in all at the same time. `@auto` tools, one of the set of libraries that we developed here, allows us to do automatic dependency management. For example, `@auto` will find out the dependents of a package that was updated, and update them in turn. This kind of thing works more smoothly when sharing repositories, so we opted for having all in the same place.

So far, the _Metarepo_ is working really well for us, but we are aware it might present a bit a learning curve. The upshot is that you don't have to worry about a project being moved in here, projects placed in here are the same as before and are being actively worked on, the reason they are being moved here is simpler logistics.
